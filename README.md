## APICExpeditor

A simple GUI-based deployment tool for IBM API Connect that works as an alternative to
IBM's developer toolkit command-line tool.

#### The tool supports both yaml and json files.

The tool is capable of (so far):
- Creating different environments' profiles to quickly switch and deploy to different environments.
- Publishing products.
- Viewing published products.
- Publishing global policies from global policy files or OpenAPI files.
- Assigning global policies as pre-hook, post-hook, or error.
- Updating global policies from OpenAPI files.
- Deleting, viewing, and downloading global policies.

The tool was tested on [LTE 10.0.5.0](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6592957).
