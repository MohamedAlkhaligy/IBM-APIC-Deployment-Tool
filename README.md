## IBM API Connect Deployment Tool

A simple GUI-based deployment tool for IBM API Connect that works as an alternative to
the developer toolkit command-line tool.

#### The tool supports yaml-based files.

The tool is capable of (so far):
- Publishing products.
- Publishing, deleting, and viewing global policies
- Assigning global policies as pre-hook, post-hook, or error.

The tool was tested on [LTE 10.0.5.0](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6592957)
